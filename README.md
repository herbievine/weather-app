## Weather App
#### What is it?
This is a simple Node.js weather app. It gets your location from your IP once you launch the site (if allowed) and gives you information about the weather. The user can also search town and cities to find the corresponding weather data. This app is also equipped with the Google Cloud Maps API which renders a map in real time.
#### How to use/test
For now, there is no way to test this. However, looking forward, this app will be available online.
